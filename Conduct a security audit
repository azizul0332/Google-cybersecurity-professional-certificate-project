# Botium Toys: Scope, Goals, and Risk Assessment Report

## Scope and Goals of the Audit

### Scope
The scope of this audit is defined as the entire security program at Botium Toys. This includes their assets like employee equipment and devices, their internal network, and their systems. You will need to review the assets Botium Toys has and the controls and compliance practices they have in place.

### Goals
Assess existing assets and complete the controls and compliance checklist to determine which controls and compliance best practices need to be implemented to improve Botium Toys’ security posture.

---

## Current Assets

Assets managed by the IT Department include:  

- **On-premises equipment** for in-office business needs.  
- **Employee equipment**: end-user devices (desktops/laptops, smartphones), remote workstations, headsets, cables, keyboards, mice, docking stations, surveillance cameras, etc.  
- **Storefront products**: Available for retail sale on-site and online; stored in the company’s adjoining warehouse.  
- **Systems, software, and services management**: Accounting, telecommunication, database, security, e-commerce, and inventory management.  
- **Internet access**.  
- **Internal network**.  
- **Data retention and storage**.  
- **Legacy system maintenance**: End-of-life systems that require human monitoring.

---

## Risk Assessment

### Risk Description
Currently, there is inadequate management of assets. Additionally, Botium Toys does not have all of the proper controls in place and may not be fully compliant with U.S. and international regulations and standards.

### Control Best Practices
The first of the five functions of the NIST CSF is **Identify**. Botium Toys will need to dedicate resources to identify assets so they can appropriately manage them. Additionally, they will need to classify existing assets and determine the impact of the loss of existing assets, including systems, on business continuity.

### Risk Score
On a scale of 1 to 10, the **risk score** is **8**, which is fairly high. This is due to a lack of controls and adherence to compliance best practices.

---

## Additional Comments

The potential impact from the loss of an asset is rated as **medium**, because the IT department does not know which assets would be at risk. The risk to assets or fines from governing bodies is **high** because Botium Toys does not have all of the necessary controls in place and is not fully adhering to best practices related to compliance regulations that keep critical data private/secure. 

### Specific Details:
- Currently, all Botium Toys employees have access to internally stored data and may be able to access cardholder data and customers’ PII/SPII.
- Encryption is not currently used to ensure confidentiality of customers’ credit card information that is accepted, processed, transmitted, and stored locally in the company’s internal database.
- Access controls pertaining to **least privilege** and **separation of duties** have not been implemented.
- The IT department has ensured **availability** and integrated controls to ensure **data integrity**.
- The IT department has a **firewall** that blocks traffic based on an appropriately defined set of security rules.
- **Antivirus software** is installed and monitored regularly by the IT department.
- The IT department has **not installed an intrusion detection system (IDS)**.
- There are **no disaster recovery plans** currently in place, and the company does not have backups of critical data.
- The IT department has established a plan to notify E.U. customers within **72 hours** if there is a security breach.
- **Privacy policies, procedures, and processes** have been developed and are enforced among IT department members and other employees to properly document and maintain data.
- Although a password policy exists, its requirements are nominal and not in line with current minimum password complexity requirements (e.g., at least eight characters, a combination of letters, and at least one number; special characters).
- There is no centralized **password management system** that enforces the password policy’s minimum requirements, which sometimes affects productivity when employees/vendors submit a ticket to the IT department to recover or reset a password.
- While legacy systems are monitored and maintained, there is **no regular schedule** in place for these tasks and intervention methods are unclear.
- The store’s physical location, which includes Botium Toys’ main offices, store front, and warehouse of products, has sufficient locks, up-to-date **closed-circuit television (CCTV)** surveillance, as well as functioning **fire detection and prevention systems**.







# Control Categories in Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity controls are grouped into three main categories:

- **Administrative/Managerial Controls**
- **Technical Controls**
- **Physical/Operational Controls**

---

## Administrative/Managerial Controls

Administrative or managerial controls address the human component of cybersecurity. These controls include policies and procedures that define how an organization manages data and outline employee responsibilities. While administrative controls are often policy-based, their enforcement may require technical or physical controls.

### **Examples of Administrative Controls**

| **Control Name**            | **Control Type** | **Control Purpose**                                                                                     |
|-----------------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Password Management   | Preventative     | Reduce password fatigue.                                                           |
| Antivirus (AV) Software| Preventative     | Scan to detect and quarantine known threats.                                       |
| Manual Monitoring and Maintenance | Preventative | Identify and manage risks or vulnerabilities in out-of-date systems.              |

## Control Types Overview

Controls serve different purposes and can include:  
- **Preventative Controls**: Designed to prevent incidents (e.g., firewalls, locks).  
- **Corrective Controls**: Used to restore systems after an incident (e.g., backups, disaster recovery plans).  
- **Detective Controls**: Implemented to identify incidents (e.g., IDS, CCTV).  
- **Deterrent Controls**: Discourage attacks by increasing the effort or risk for the attacker (e.g., signage, encryption).

Together, these controls provide **defense in depth**, enhancing overall cybersecurity and asset protection.
